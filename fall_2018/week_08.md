## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week, to my disappointment, I did not to get a lot of progress done but I did start extending the base project and creating another page. However I ran into the problem of page routing

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to continue creating the article page and learn react routing

## Anything Blocking?


I found react routing difficult to learn and still do not understand it.
