## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week I added to my tic-tac-toe reactjs application. The features I have added are row and column labels to each move button and bolded the current move. I learned how to use the map function and use condtional classes to implement conditional styling on certain elements. I am slightly dissapointed that I did not start page templates.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

This week I plan to create an article view page

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.
> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

My limited knowledge of JavaScript definaltely slows down development a little bit.


## Notes
