## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This past week I worked on creating wireframes for the article page and started developing what the content JSON would contain and strucured. I also started working on the article component and read more documentation on react routers. Most importantly, I worked on the presentation and reflected on the work my team did this semester and where we are going.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

Finalize presentation and continue working on lesson and article view.

This week I plan to continue creating the article page and learn react routing

## Anything Blocking?
> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I do not how the model will be strucutured so for me it is difficult for me to contruct the view.
