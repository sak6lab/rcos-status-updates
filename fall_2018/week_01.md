## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I researched about about Flask, Bootstrap, and RESTful api.

## This Week's Plan

Complete the flask turorial and continue to learn bootstrap.

## Anything Blocking?
I have not touched python in a while.

## Notes
I feel we are using the wrong technology for the frontend. Flask is a backend technology.
