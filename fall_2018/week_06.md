## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I finished the ReactJS tutorial that created a tic-tac-toe

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to continue to learn ReactJS by adding to tic-tac-toe application I built through the tutorial. I also plan to start designing templates in ReactJS.

## Anything Blocking?

I am having trouble with knowing where to start and understanding the workflow of creating templates


## Notes

Data structures takes a lot of time that could be used to make templates
