## Last Week's Accomplishments
This past week I mocked up the article page and made a dynamic header for an article. To make the article body dynamic I need to use react-html-parser, a library to convert html embeded into html elements. 

## This Week's Plan
Finish Article component and start Articles view. First I will make a mockup of the articles view and then use the same development flow as I did for the article view.

## Anything Blocking?
Backend specificication would make planning how to handle article body data.

## Notes
N/A
