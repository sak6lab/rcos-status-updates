## Last Week's Accomplishments
This past week I finished making the Article component rely on a dynamic json file. I also drew up a mockup of the articles view. While drawing it up I thought about how the articles view might be used and how it should be laid out. I figuered I would just use a chronological list view as each articles follows the other. I imagine the student to read each article and complete each practice code section in the article and then go on to the project. I may need to create a component for the code section later as specification develops. In that case the articles are more like lessons so maybe should be renamed.

## This Week's Plan
Finish Articles component with dynamic data. Re-do Articles component with midset focused on page will show all articles and not articles specific to a curriculum.
