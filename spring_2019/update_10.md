## Last Week's Accomplishments
I finished the mockup and developed the static home page in react. There is some styling fixes that need to made. 

## This Week's Plan
Fix some minute styling errors. Merge homepage to master. Prepare for presentation on Tuesday 23rd. Make final edits to website before the end of the year.
## Anything Blocking?

## Notes
Now that we are done with the structure of Spaceport, Next semester the focus should be on tying all components of Spaceport together and increase production on content. The site is 'dynamic' right now but has no api to feed information for the site.
