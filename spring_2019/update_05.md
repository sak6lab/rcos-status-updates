## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week I mock-uped the search page similarly to the style of github's design of the search page. 

## This Week's Plan
Since it is spring break, I plan to have the search page built in react with the ability to load dynamic data. Hopefully, after spring break we can start piecing together the different components and start send real data to the React app.
