## Last Week's Accomplishments
In the middle of wireframing the new articles page, I realized why should the articles page be a search for only articles. I instead thought instead of having a search page for all articles there should be a overall search for curriculums, articles, and projects. Nevertheless, I wireframed the articles page keeping in mind it is a articles search page.

## This Week's Plan
Now that we realized that the article view is unnecessary and it is better to have a over arching search view, I will build a mockup for the search view and start to build the search view in React.
