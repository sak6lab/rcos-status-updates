## Last Week's Accomplishments
Created a sample artice for the demo curriculum about the list data structure in Python. Made sure the article had enough differing elements to correctly test view. I also wrote the [test-articles](https://github.com/codingandcommunity/test-articles) readme to define how articles should be structured.

## This Week's Plan
Make a mockup for the home page for Spaceport. This should be a static page that for now that tell people where to start with the site.

## Anything Blocking?
