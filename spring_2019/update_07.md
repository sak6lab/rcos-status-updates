## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week I fixed the routing bug in searching by wrapping the navbar component in withRouter as it is not a component that is routed in the first place. 

## This Week's Plan
I plan to flesh out search page to use data from a sample json file.

## Anything Blocking?
Definition of how data will be given to me. We need to make sure all spaceport devs know purpose and I think even though we are not directly working on backend we should have an idea on how it works and laid out.

## Notes
N/A
