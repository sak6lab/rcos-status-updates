## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week I started working on the search page. I have made the nessacary components for the search functionality. I also added a search bar at the navbar. I reach a problem that does not allow me to navigate to the search url correctly as it reaches an infinite loop when the navbar tries to change the url to the search url but it is currently on the search url.

## This Week's Plan
I plan to fix this problem (need to do a lot of reading on history and withRouter) and hopefully start working on fleshing out how search will work in terms with backend.
