## Last Week's Accomplishments
This past week I started the article page by building a sample static article for the application. I also started to think about the json data model may look and created my first mockup of sample response that would result from a POST request. I realized we may need a solution to creating article posts that translates regular article content into html elements that would in turn be sent in the json, rather than the front end dealing with parsing content and deciphering how the content was meant to be displayed.

## This Week's Plan
Continue fleshing out static article page elements and start to make page more dynamic by sending the article some mockup data.
